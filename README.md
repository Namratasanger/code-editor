## Code Note

This is a browser-based code editor that allows users to write and run Javascript code directly in their browser. It is built using React, Redux, and Typescript, and is designed to mimic the functionality of a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

- Write and run Javascript code directly in the browser
- Execute user-provided code safely and securely
- Bundling and transpiling of code done directly in the browser using Web Assembly
- Uses the same code editor as VSCode
- Multi-package architecture allows for easy deployment to NPM registry
- Comprehensive error handling and performance optimizations
